Process of Mastering DSA

My DSA Practice Journey
Welcome to my DSA Practice Repository! ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems I have solved, organized by topic. I started learning DSA to improve my problem-solving skills for coding interviews and competitive programming. This repository contains my progress, solutions, and explanations, and I hope it serves as a helpful resource for anyone learning DSA.

Topics Covered:
Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks & Queues
Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
Graphs (BFS, DFS)
Dynamic Programming
Sorting & Searching Algorithms
Greedy Algorithms
Backtracking
Structure:
Each folder contains:

Problem Statements: A brief description of the problem.
Solution: Code in my preferred programming language.
Explanation: Detailed step-by-step approach to solve the problem.
